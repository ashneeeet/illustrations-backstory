    <h1>﴾BACKSTORIES OF ILLUSTRATIONS﴿</h1>
    <ul>
         <li>
             <img src="shinchan.png" width="450px" height="300px" alt="shinchan"/> <h1> Shinchan </h1> You know him right? The iconic and everyone's favorite Shinchan Nohara.
             I started a cartoon-series on my Instagram page where I decided to post one cartoon each on 7 days. I made these all in my own art style. This was the first one I made. It was made on Photoshop.
        </li>
        
        <li>
             <img src="doraemon.png" width="300px" height="300px" alt="doraemon"/> <h1>Doraemon </h1> This was the second cartoon in the same series. After
            Shinchan, my second favorite anime is Doraemon. So it got a place here! It was made on Photoshop.
        </li>
        
        <li>
             <img src="pikachu.png" width="300px" height="300px" alt="pikachu"/> <h1> Pikachu </h1> Pika! Pika! Pikachu!! I made this cutie as the third cartoon in my series. 
            The background was my own design. It was made to depict Pikachu's unique and out-of-the-world abilities. It was made on Photoshop.
        </li>
        
        <li>
             <img src="perman.png" width="300px" height="300px" alt="perman"/> <h1> Perman </h1> Remember him? To depict his flying powers, I designed the background
            as a 3-d yet 2-d looking clear sky. He is standing on a cloud. This was the fourth one in the series. It was made on Photoshop.
        </li>
        
        <li>
             <img src="BTS.png" width="550px" height="300px" alt="BTS"/> <h1>BTS</h1> This was my favorite but it took the most time to be made.
            RM and Jin loom the most realistic and I personally like what I made here. This was a much appreciated and the most-liked post on my social media. 
            14 people saved it on their accounts! It was a pleasant surprise. It was made on Photoshop.
        </li>
        
        <li>
             <img src="girl with icecream.png" width="300px" height="400px" alt="icecream lover"/> <h1> Girl with Icecream </h1> Here I reveal how I design my characters. I wanted an
            anime-like character. So, I randomly picked up a page and started thinking about some common actions. It was summer season and what I was craving the most was ice-cream. 
            Hence, the icecream in the image. Next, I wanted to give her a cute look. Thus, I made her hair short, also depicting the extreme summer. She also is wearing
            ear-headband. That makes her a child-like girl. The shirt has been given yellow, a hot color again depicting the hot weather. It was made on Photoshop.
        </li>
        
        <li>
             <img src="boy with phone.png" width="300px" height="450px" alt="pretty boy"/> <h1> Boy with Phone </h1>The toughest thing in this was giving the background. I wanted to
            show him on the other side of the city, so the city is in the backdrop. But it was fun making it all. The guy is a spoilt one, with his face deceiving you into thinking
            he is an innocent one. He is depcited as someone who came to enjoy the weather instead of going to study at school, hence the uniform. It was made on Photoshop.
        </li>
        
         <li>
            <img src="marshmello.png"width="450px"height="300px"alt="marshmello"> <h1>Marshmello</h1>This is a fanart of the famous Western singer Marshmello. This was made
             on Photoshop. It was comparatively easy than others I had made earlier.
        </li>
      
        <li>
            <img src="chimmy.png" width="350px"height="350px" alt="chimmy"><h1>Chimmy</h1> This is Chimmy, the BT21 representative character
            of Park Ji-Min of BTS, a South-Korean boy-band. I made this as a request was made to me by my friend (who
            is also a fan of BTS like me) when she thought I could make this cute kid easily. Here is the result. Made on Photoshop.
        </li>  
        
         <li>
             <img src="tatabt21.png"width="200px"height="325px"alt="tata"> <h1>Tata</h1> This is Tata, the BT21 representative character
            of Kim Tae-Hyung of BTS. My friend wanted me to make all the characters. So, it is one of those.

        <li>
             <img src="rj bt21.png"width="225px"height="350px"alt="RJ"> <h1>RJ</h1> This is RJ, the BT21 representative character
            of Kim Seok-Jin of BTS. I used a different technique to make this but it was still made on Photoshop. Resembles the real one, doesn't it?
        </li>
        
        <li>
             <img src="shookie.png"width="450px"height="350px"alt="shookie"> <h1>Shookie</h1> This is Shookie, the BT21 representative character
            of Min Suga of BTS. I like the effects on its body that were made using Overlay and white color in Photoshop. It is basically a cookie.
        </li>
        
        <li>
             <img src="cooky.png" width="300px" height="300px" alt="cooky"/> <h1> Cooky </h1> Ironically, the one who is actually named Cooky isn't a cookie but a bunny! This
            is the representative BT21 series character of Jeon Jungkook of BTS.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <img src="bubby.png" width="350px"height="450px"alt="bubby"><h1>Bubby</h1> This is Bubby, a baby-doll I own,
            which my grandmother's mother bought for me when she went to England. She is no more
            but I love this doll so much that it is always with me and that's why I made this. Made on Photoshop.
